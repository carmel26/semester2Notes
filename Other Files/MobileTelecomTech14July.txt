a spectrum is all radio waves, spectrum is frequency. infrared are used in differents ways,
micro waves 

ofdm issue is power consomptation
ofdm advantage is easy to design

there is too many call drop in 2G than to 4G.
in 4G there is soft handover, and hard handover

With omn direction antena are 360 degrees and
 direction antena's are 120degrees this approach helps to efficeint reusability of frequence

Multple access :
 *Frequence division multple access: using differents speech frequence when we are talking in a room for to differenciate speakers
 *time division multiple access : waiting each person to talk in each time one by one in a room
 *code division multiple access : using differents languages in talking in kirundi,kinyagwanda,...

simplex: oneway communication 
half duplex: two way communication but one talk and other listen
full duplex: two way communication and every one talk ata the same time each other

2G is the bleuprint of all the next technologies (it is a base off all technologies)

handover happens when you shift place between two differnts bts(because the frenquence u used
 in one place is not available to the new place)

3dB one is 2 times bigger than other
6dB one is 4 times bigger than other
